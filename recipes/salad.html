        <p>it's exactly what it sounds like bozo ok</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of minced garlic</li>
            <li>Lemon juice from 1 lemon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of L and P Worch Sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of mayo</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all of the ingredients in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Put in 4 ounces of Romaine and some Curley Parsley.</li>
            <li>Use a good zester to grate about 0.5 of Asiago cheese into the salad. A good zester is one where you literally don't have to put any effort into grating the cheese. They can be hard to find.</li>
            <li>Toss everything with your hand.</li>
